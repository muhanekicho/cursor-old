**Assignee:** TBD

**Description:**
Design the core architecture for the headless service, including component separation, service boundaries, and communication patterns.

**Tasks:**
- Analyze current codebase architecture
- Identify components to extract/reuse
- Design service layer architecture
- Define API boundaries and contracts
- Document architecture decisions

**Acceptance Criteria:**

### HDLS-2: Setup Initial API Server
**Type:** Backend
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Effort:** 2 days
**Assignee:** TBD

**Description:**
Create the initial Node.js API server structure that will serve as the foundation for the headless service.

**Tasks:**
- Configure Node.js server with Express/Fastify

### HDLS-3: Implement Authentication System
**Type:** Backend/Security
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Effort:** 3 days
**Assignee:** TBD

**Description:**
Create an authentication system for the API to secure endpoints and identify users.

**Tasks:**
- Design authentication flow
- Implement JWT-based authentication
- Create user management endpoints
- Add middleware for authentication verification
- Document authentication process

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users can register and login
- JWT tokens are generated and validated
- Protected routes require authentication
- Token refresh mechanism works
- Authentication errors are properly handled

### HDLS-4: Extract Core Cursor Functionality
**Type:** Backend
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Effort:** 4 days
**Assignee:** TBD

**Description:**
Extract the core functionality from the current Cursor implementation to be exposed through the API.

**Tasks:**
- Identify core capabilities to extract
- Separate UI logic from core functionality
- Create service classes for core features
- Ensure functionality works without UI components
- Write unit tests for extracted functionality

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Core functionality works independently
- No UI dependencies in extracted code
- Service classes have clear interfaces
- Unit tests cover key functionality
- Performance comparable to original implementation

---

### HDLS-5: Develop Base API Endpoints
**Type:** Backend
**Priority:** Medium
**Estimated Effort:** 3 days
**Assignee:** TBD

**Description:**
Implement the first set of API endpoints that expose core Cursor functionality.

**Tasks:**
- Define endpoint structure and naming conventions
- Implement file-related endpoints (list, read, write)
- Create project management endpoints
- Add configuration endpoints
- Document API using OpenAPI/Swagger

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Endpoints follow RESTful principles
- API responses are properly formatted
- Error handling is consistent
- API documentation is generated
- Endpoints can be tested via Postman/Insomnia

---

### HDLS-6: Create Initial CLI Structure
**Type:** CLI
**Priority:** Medium
**Estimated Effort:** 2 days
**Assignee:** TBD

**Description:**
Develop the initial structure for the CLI that will interact with the headless service.

**Tasks:**
- Setup CLI project structure
- Implement command parsing framework
- Create help and version commands
- Add configuration management
- Establish API client for CLI

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- CLI can be installed and executed
- Help command displays available commands
- Version information is accurate
- Configuration can be set/retrieved
- CLI can connect to API server

---

### HDLS-7: Implement API Testing Framework
**Type:** QA
**Priority:** Medium
**Estimated Effort:** 2 days
**Assignee:** TBD

**Description:**
Set up a comprehensive testing framework for the API endpoints.

**Tasks:**
- Configure testing environment
- Create test utilities and helpers
- Implement first test suites
- Setup CI integration for tests
- Create testing documentation

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Testing framework runs successfully
- Key endpoints have tests
- CI pipeline executes tests
- Test reporting is available
- Code coverage is tracked

---

### HDLS-8: Create Service Documentation
**Type:** Documentation
**Priority:** Low
**Estimated Effort:** 1 day
**Assignee:** TBD

**Description:**
Create initial documentation for the headless service architecture and usage.

**Tasks:**
- Document installation process
- Create architecture overview
- Document API endpoints
- Add CLI usage examples
- Prepare development setup instructions

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Documentation is clear and accurate
- Setup instructions work as described
- API documentation matches implementation
- CLI examples function correctly
- Documentation follows standard format
