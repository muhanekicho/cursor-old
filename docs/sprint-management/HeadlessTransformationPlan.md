# Cursor Headless Transformation: Sprint Plan

## Project Overview

This document outlines the plan to transform Cursor (CodeMirror version) into a headless service that can be used programmatically without the UI components. The headless version will provide a powerful API and CLI that can be integrated into various development workflows, CI/CD pipelines, and custom development environments.

## Objectives

1. Create a robust API layer exposing core Cursor functionality
2. Separate UI from logic to enable headless operation
3. Enable integration with external tools and services
4. Provide programmatic access to LSP capabilities
5. Maintain compatibility with existing Cursor features
6. Develop comprehensive documentation and examples

## Timeline

The project is divided into 6 sprints of 2 weeks each, for a total duration of 12 weeks:

- **Sprint 1:** Core Architecture & API Foundation
- **Sprint 2:** File System & LSP Service Extraction
- **Sprint 3:** Document Processing & CLI Implementation
- **Sprint 4:** State Management & Integration Points
- **Sprint 5:** WebSocket Support & Performance Optimization
- **Sprint 6:** Packaging, Documentation & Testing

## Success Criteria

1. All core features available through API/CLI
2. Performance comparable to or better than UI version
3. Comprehensive documentation with examples
4. CI/CD integration examples
5. Container deployment options
6. Unit and integration tests with >80% coverage

- Performance test suite

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| LSP integration complexity | High | Medium | Start with simpler language servers, gradually add complex ones |
| Performance degradation | High | Low | Regular benchmarking, optimization sprints |
| API design limitations | Medium | Medium | Thorough planning, extensible design patterns |
| Compatibility issues | Medium | Medium | Comprehensive testing, versioning strategy |
| Documentation gaps | Medium | Low | Documentation-driven development, user feedback |

## Dependencies

- Node.js ecosystem
- Language Server Protocol implementations
- CodeMirror core (possibly without UI components)
- File system monitoring tools
- WebSocket libraries

## Team Structure

- Back-end developers (2-3)
- DevOps engineer (1)
- Technical writer (1, part-time)
- QA engineer (1)
- Project manager (1)

## Next Steps

Begin with Sprint 1 immediately after approval. Regular sprint reviews will be conducted at the end of each sprint to assess progress and adjust plans as necessary.
